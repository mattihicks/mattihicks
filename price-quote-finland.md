title: Price quote in Finland
date: 2018
intro: To increase the number of leads of the <a href="https://mattihicks.com/education-first">new EF digital model</a>, our team was asked to implement a price quote form although the price breakdown is provided on the site. <br/><br/>Five months after this feature was introduced, I was asked to research why customers ordered a price quote on our new digital model.

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Context matters</h2>
        <p>To ground the research in the company knowledge we already had, I spoke with stakeholders and dug into archives to discover where it came from and why stakeholders held strong beliefs in its effectiveness for lead conversion. I wanted to undertand why the price quote was a quantitative success and what tests they have done to improve it over the years.</p>
        <p>I then poured over quantitative reports showing how the price quotation CTA compared to other CTAs on the site and also created an analytics dashboard to see current drop off rates within each step of the form.</p>
<p>This work helped me to build a solid research foundation on, so that moving forward I could work within the context of the problem space as well as communicate the research findings in an effective way.</p>

        <p>After working with the project team and business leadership on the research objectives and context, I decided to <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">survey</span> people who have recently filled out a price quote. From this survey, I took the most recent (within the past week) and "data rich" responses and conducted a round of <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">phone and Skype interviews</span> to gather deeper information.</p>

 <!--        <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">1. Customer interviews</h4> -->
<p>I sent a short 3-minute survey to over four hundred people who have recently (within the past two months) filled out a price quotation form. Here are a couple of questions I asked:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Why did you fill out a form to get a price quote?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Did you fill out a price quote before or after you looked browsed a destination page?</span></p> 
<p>We received more than one hundred responses and I shared them with my project team. Sidenote: as we received over 25% response rate, I wish I'd made the survey longer (taking perhaps 8 minutes instead of 3) and asked more questions, although this may have led to a decrease in response rate.</p>

<p>Although I cannot discuss the actual findings for confidentiality reasons, we discovered an interested theme in about half of the responses about why people filled out a price quote form.</p>
<p>I needed to probe deeper into this insight.</p>

        <p>To avoid hindsight bias, I recruited people who have requested a price quotation within the past week. Each of these interview recruits had responses that I wanted to go deeper into. Example questions asked:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Do you remember seeing the price on the website? If so, where?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Was there information on the site that you weren't getting that made you want to fill out a price quote form?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Did you tell anyone you ordered a price quote? If so, who? What did they say?</span></p>

        <p>As a result of this research, I collaborated with the product owner to plan a list of experiments to improve people's ability to get an exact price directly from the site, without decreasing lead generation. This includes:</p>
        <ul><li class="objectiveResearchList">New components on the destination page</li>
          <li class="objectiveResearchList">A/B testing CTA copy</li>
          <li class="objectiveResearchList">A/B testing price quote form versions to decrease drop off rates</li></ul>
        <p>This research also builds on other <a href="https://mattihicks.com/customer-journey">research efforts</a> which are trying to bring a more personable and authentic experience to the product. I am currently testing an chat bot, which is introduced by a video from one of our language consultants letting the customer know that they are available to help them at any time:</p>
