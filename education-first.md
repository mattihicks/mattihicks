        <h2 class="projectTitle">Context</h2>
        <p>In 2016 the EF Finland websiteâ€™s primary purpose was to get customers phone numbers through a price quote or a brochure request. The sales person would then call the customer and try to convince them to travel broad.</p>
        <p>We were asked by senior leadership to develop a new digital model, where the website informs potential customers about the product and allows them to easily book online, without directly interfacing with a salesperson. In addition, we were asked to focus on mobile.</p>
        <p>As one of two products designers, I was involved in every aspect of this project.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Design research</h2>
        <p>After senior leadership gave us the short brief, I had to understand if their assumption - that people would book an expensive language course directly online - was valid. I flew to Helsinki and did a deep dive with customers and the sales team, learning about students and parents and the sales process, students' motivations to learn a language abroad, and how technology could help them make the decision to book easier.</p>
        <p>
        From this research, I sketched user flows and created wireframe prototypes and then tested them in the Helsinki sales office to better understand how users would be more likely to book directly online.</p>

        <p>Based on what we learned in user research, here are some of the insights we implemented into the final design:</p>
        <p>1. Students and their parents are likely to book directly online if the website content is tailored to their specific age group.</p>

          2. We found that most of our customers spend several months to a year before deciding to travel abroad. For these users, we implemented a feature that allows you to save and compare study abroad trips over time called "My Trips".</p>
<p>
          3. To encourage people to book a course online, we learned that price transparency and flexibility is key. I designed the booking flow so that the price is on every step after they decide when they want to travel. I also worked with the business so that users can reserve a course and cancel within two weeks - rather than directly book and be locked into an expensive trip.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Impact</h2>
        <p>We have shifted the company paradigm of what makes an online experience successful: instead of asking potential customers for their phone numbers and addresses, the internal conversation has shifted to creating a content-rich website that promotes booking directly online. In addition, one year after launch, customers are booking twice as much online as they are over the phone.</p>
        <p>
         Senior leadership has asked us to expand this work into other markets, which will begin in the coming months.</p>
