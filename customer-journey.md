title: Customer journey mapping
date: 2018
intro: After leading the research for a <a href="https://mattihicks.com/education-first">new digital model</a>, I was asked to conduct exit interviews focusing on the customer experience. I reframed the research ask and got stakeholder buy-in to instead trace the entire customer journey across two markets, as previous research indicated the upcoming product roadmap needed to consider all digital touchpoints for us to move forward in an impactful way. <br/><br/>For brevity, I've combined the two different markets for this case study as the methods used and process followed were similar.

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Methods</h2>
        <p>After working with stakeholders on the research objectives, I decided to utilize semi-structured interviews with the following sample groups to meet the research objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        Ten to fifteen <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">student interviews</span> with those between 16-18 years old who have experienced a language course abroad within the past 12 months</li>
        <li class="objectiveResearchList">Four to five <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">parent interviews</span> who have booked and sent their child on a language course abroad within the past 12 months</li>
        <li class="objectiveResearchList">Eight to ten <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">sales coordinator</span> and <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">customer service team interviews</span> who help customers throughout the language trip</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Along with my research team, I also conducted an affinity diagramming workshop and a sales blueprint exercise with marketing, sales, and customer service representatives to provide additional context to the interview data.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Involving the project team</h2>
        <p>It's critical to involve the project team and other stakeholders in the research process as much as possible - they are owners of the process, too. Everyone on the team is invited to contribute to the research - from formulating the research questions to conducting the user interviews to ideating on what kind of deliverables the team can expect. In addition, each day I am out on the field, I write in and share a field journal where I jot down sentiments or thoughts from the research day with a fair warning that we cannot make conclusions yet on what we are discovering - but it helps the team to "peer in" to what's ongoing if they're busy.</p>

        <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">1. Customer interviews</h4>
<p>Customer interviews was partly influenced by the <a href="https://jtbd.info/">JTBD theory</a> to get to the heart of how the digital touchpoints impact the customer experience. Example questions asked:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">What was the conversation like when you talked about learning a language abroad with your parents? With your friends?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">To parent: what were your initial thoughts about your daughter studying abroad?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">How did you contact friends and family back home?</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">If you were traveling abroad again with EF, what would you hope to get out of
your next trip?</span></p>
        <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">2. Sales and customer service team interviews</h4>
<p>To add context to the customer journey, I interviewed between 6-8 sales coodinators and 1-2 customer service team members from each market. During these interviews, I dived into their relationships with customers during their language trip, asking questions such as:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">How do you first get in touch with customers?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">What questions do customers ask?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">What are the most common customer complaints you hear?</span></p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Results and action steps</h2>
        <p>I can't disclose my findings for confidentiality reasons, but here's some of the outcomes and action items I took:</p>
        <p>1. I created a <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">customer journey diagram with eight stages</span> that the customer experiences throughout their EF journey. We are currently building on this research to go deeper within the eight stages I defined. In addition to the stages, I also outlined opportunities to address discovered painpoints within each stage.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>2. I am collaborating with the product owner as this research directly impacts the <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">product roadmap</span>; we've uncovered multiple product opportunities for 2019, and most likely beyond.</p>
        <p>3. <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular">Feature and content improvements</span> are in planning, development, or testing stages, including providing more information about what the student will experience as well as an increased emphasis on authenticity in the product.</p>

        <p>As an example of what it means to present more information and authenticity in our product, I created a video with a videographer for the Finnish market showing what happens when parents send their child on an EF language trip.</p> <p>I conducted all the on-camera interviews, drew the storyboard, directed the editing changes, and pushed it live onto the <a href="https://ef.fi/languagesabroad/#/">product website</a>:</p>
