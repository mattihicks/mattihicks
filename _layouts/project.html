        <h2 class="projectTitle">Context</h2>
        <p>In 2016 the EF Finland website’s primary purpose was to get customers phone numbers through a price quote or a brochure request. The sales person would then call the customer and try to convince them to travel broad.</p>

        <p>We were asked by senior leadership to develop a new digital model, where the website informs potential customers about the product and allows them to easily book online, without directly interfacing with a salesperson. In addition, we were asked to focus on mobile.</p>

        <p>As one of two products designers, I was involved in every aspect of this project.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Design research</h2>
        <p>After senior leadership gave us the short brief, I had to understand if their assumption - that people would book an expensive language course directly online - was valid. I flew to Helsinki and conducted research with customers and the sales team, learning about students motivations to learn a language abroad and how the website could help them make the decision easier.</p>
        <p>
        From this research, I sketched user flows and created wireframe prototypes and then tested them in the Helsinki sales office to better understand how users would be more likely to book directly online.</p>

          2. We found that most of our customers spend several months to a year before deciding to travel abroad. For these users, we implemented a feature that allows you to save and compare study abroad trips over time called "My Trips".</p>
<p>
          3. To encourage people to book a course online, we learned that price transparency and flexibility is key. I designed the booking flow so that the price is on every step after they decide when they want to travel. I also worked with the business so that users can reserve a course and cancel within two weeks - rather than directly book and be locked into an expensive trip.</p>

        <p>

        For booking a language trip, I had to first consider: what does the user want to do first? My interview data told me that customers wanted to pick when they would be going. However, I also learned that customers also wanted to easily be able to compare different prices depending on the number of weeks selected to travel. To compare prices accurately, a course selection would first need to be made.</p>
        <p>After sketching flows, I prototyped a few different concepts:</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>Based on what we learned in user research, here are some of the insights we implemented into the final design:
<br/><br/>
1. Students and their parents are likely to book directly online if the website content is tailored to their specific age group, if they can easily find the information they need (for example, regarding insurance or accommodation), and if they could easily have their questions answered through in-app messaging.
<br/><br/>
2. We found that most of our customers spend several months to a year before deciding to travel abroad. For these users, we implemented a feature that allows you to save and compare study abroad trips over time called "My Trips".
<br/><br/>
3. To encourage people to book a course online, we learned that price transparency and flexibility is key. I designed the booking flow so that the price is on every step after they decide when they want to travel. I also worked with the business so that users can reserve a course and cancel within two weeks - rather than directly book and be locked into an expensive trip.
<br/><br/>
As one of two product designers, I was involved in every aspect of the site. The areas where I had the most impact were: customer insights and design ideation, content strategy, the school experience pages, and the booking flows.

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Impact</h2>
        <p>

        We have shifted the company paradigm of what makes an online experience successful: instead of asking potential customers for their phone numbers and addresses, the internal conversation has shifted to creating a content-rich website that promotes booking directly online. In addition, one year after launch, customers are booking twice as much online as they are over the phone.</p>
        <p>
         Senior leadership has asked us to expand this work into other markets, which will begin in the coming months.</p>
