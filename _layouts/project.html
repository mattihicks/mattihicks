        <h2 class="projectTitle">Context</h2>
        <p>In 2016 almost 100,000 EF brochures were mailed out throughout Finland to convince prospective students to learn a language abroad. The following year, senior leadership decided to cut brochures for Finland entirely and make a team of one creative director, two product designers (including me), one visual designer, and three engineers responsible for redesigning the product websites with a focus on online booking.
<br/><br/>
We were given four months to research, design, build, and launch the product before the sales season began.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Discovery and research</h2>
        <p>
After senior leadership gave us the short brief, we set out to understand what problems we’re actually tackling and to prioritize them according to user and business needs.
<br/><br/>
I had to understand if their assumption - that people would book an expensive language course directly online - was valid. After sketching user flows, I created wireframe prototypes and tested them with Finnish users and the sales team to better understand how users would be more likely to book directly online.

        <h2 class="projectTitle">What we built</h2>
<p>Based on what we learned in user research, here are some of the insights we implemented into the final design:
<br/><br/>
1. Students and their parents are likely to book directly online if the website content is tailored to their specific age group, if they can easily find the information they need (for example, regarding insurance or accommodation), and if they could easily have their questions answered through in-app messaging.
<br/><br/>
2. We found that most of our customers spend several months to a year before deciding to travel abroad. For these users, we implemented a feature that allows you to save and compare study abroad trips over time called "My Trips".
<br/><br/>
3. To encourage people to book a course online, we learned that price transparency and flexibility is key. I designed the booking flow so that the price is on every step after they decide when they want to travel. I also worked with the business so that users can reserve a course and cancel within two weeks - rather than directly book and be locked into an expensive trip.
<br/><br/>
As one of two product designers, I was involved in every aspect of the site. The areas where I had the most impact were: customer insights and design ideation, content strategy, the school experience pages, and the booking flows (see case study).

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Impact</h2>
        <p>

We have shifted the company paradigm of what makes an online experience successful: instead of asking potential customers for their address to send a content-rich brochure, the internal conversation has shifted to creating a content-rich website that promotes booking online. Senior leadership has asked us to expand this work into other markets, which will begin in the coming months.</p>
